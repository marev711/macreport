## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/marev711/macreport/images/macreport-example-image.png)
Macreport is a collection of scripts intended to run on a Raspberry Pi connected to your local WiFi. The project is part of the final project assignment in the Harvard CS50 course, hence only the required README file is provided in this repository. The scripts will record and timestamp MAC-addresses connected to you local WiFi in an SQLITE database, and visualize the recorded entries via a Flask server run on the Pi. Macreport also provides integration to [Pushover][pushover-url] to send notifications to any mobile device when a known MAC-address reconnects to the WiFi network.

 The main purpose of the project is to illustrate, given that you have access to the hardware, how easy such monitoring is to setup, and that the course material in CS50 is more than enough to do so.


### Prerequisites

Below are the required software and how to install it. NB: If you have multiple projects on your Pi and run into dependency issues, you might want to use `pip` and a dedicated Python virtualenv for your setup.
* Raspberry Pi with Raspbian OS and WiFi card
* pyhton3
* sqlite3
* [gunicorn3][gunicorn3-url], `sudo apt install gunicorn3`
* [flask][flask-url],  `sudo apt install python3-flask`
* [svgwrite][svgwrite-url], `sudo apt install python3-svgwrite`
* [PyYAML][pyyaml-url], `sudo apt install python3-yaml`
* [Pushover account][pushover-url], register manually on site

## Getting Started

1. Setup up and connect your Raspberry Pi to your WiFi network
2. Download the macreport software directly from the author
3. Check and install the additional prerequisites above
4. Go through the configuration section steps 1-4 below
5. Test your setup by running the following command from the project root folder
   - `export MACREPORT_ROOT=<full path to project_root>`
   - `python3 macreport/scanner.py --db data/database/mac.db`</br>
   This should print some debug output to the stdout and update the database with currently connected devices
6. Fix the final configuration, step 5 and onward, to schedule the software

## Configuration
1. In the `config/macconfig.yaml`-file, update the entries listed below according to your needs. Note that other entries do not need to be updated.
   - `ip_range: 192.168.XX.X/24` - The network the Pi is using
   - `macs_to_log:` - List of IPv4 MAC addresses to store in the SQLITE database
   - `pusher:` - Settings for when to send a push notice, sub-entries are
      - `start_hour`: the time to start send notices (do not send any notice prior to this hour)
      - `min_hour_away`: Minimum number of hours time the MAC-address has to be offline before a notice is sent
   - `macs_to_push:` - List of IPv4 MAC address that may trigger a push notice
   - `person_to_macs:` - Mapping between one (1) name and one (1) or more MAC addresses. The name is used in graphics and in any push notice sent
   - `time:` - Time settings for the generated graphics, sub-entries are
      - `hours2include` - Number of hour to list in textual macreport display
      - `binsize_minutes` - The binsize aggregate for data in the SQLITE database
2. In the file `macreport/sqlite/sqlite_queries.py`, update the entry `initialize_maclookup` to match your devices that will connect. The fields to enter are,
   - `macaddr`: The IPv4 MAC-address, used to identify connected devices
   - `hostname,`: The device hostname, complements macaddr when identifying connected devices
   - `macname`: Any name, only used to remember what device the first two columns refer two
3. `export MACREPORT_ROOT=<path to project root>`
4. Run `python3 macreport/reset_db.py --db data/database/mac.db` to initialize the database.
5. Schedule the following jobs, here using crontab syntax. The flag `-p` for production is used to suppress debug/info logging from the scripts, remove it when looking for errors.
- `*/5 *  *   *   *     <path-to-python3> <path-to-macreport/scanner.py> --db <path to database> -p >> <path-to-crontab-log> 2>&1;`
- `*/6 *  *   *   *     <path-to-python3> <path-to-macreport/push-if-home.py> --db <path to database> -p >> <path-to-crontab-log> 2>&1;`
6. Start Flask via (or set a reboot command in crontab),
   - `gunicorn3 "flaskr:create_app()" -b 0.0.0.0:5050 --timeout 3600 --daemon`
7. Update the file `macreport/pushers/pushover.py` with proper `token` and `user` from the Pushover account created in section "[Getting started](#getting-started)"
8. Check that the use cases in the section below are present


## Use Cases
### Flask text view



## Roadmap
Desired features in near term are:
* Add an audio queue to a speaker connected to the Raspberry Pi when a known MAC address reconnects to the WiFi network. This should visualize ("audiolize") the ongoing monitoring and remind the persons monitored that digital monitoring is ubiquitous in their everyday life.
* Improve robustness for detecting devices connected to the WiFi network. The current `nmap` probe solution does not always work, e.g., an iPhone in sleep mode or with locked screen does not always reply.


## Contributing

Contributing is not possible as the project is intended  only as an assignment for the [CS50][cs50-url] course.
